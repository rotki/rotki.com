      Rotki is an opensource project. Opensource gives us so many benefits.
      Owning your data, transparency, auditability and more. But for all its
      positives, opensource has one major disadvantage and that is how can it be
      funded?

    <paragraph small>
      We are taking a unique and direct approach to opensource funding in Rotki.
      We are offering a premium version which adds extra features on top of the
      base application. By getting a subscription you are helping us keep the
      lights open and keep developing opensource. You also get extra benefits
      for doing so (see below for details).
