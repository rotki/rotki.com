    <heading>What is rotki?</heading>

    <paragraph>
      Rotki helps manage accounts and blockchain transactions. It’s local-first,
      privacy focused and all open source. We are long time contributors to the
      Ethereum ecosystem and general crypto space. In order to support more
      blockchains (Cosmos, Roll Ups, etc.), and to continue to ship new features
      we need the help of a backend Python developer.
    </paragraph>

    <heading secondary>How your work with us will look like?</heading>

    <paragraph>
      You will be developing new features, supporting more exchanges, more
      blockchains, and more DeFi protocols. There is also always a lot of
      troubleshooting of user reported issues, bugs, and feature requests that
      are coming our way. You can improve our current Python backend
      implementation and help us get Rotki to the next level!
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      As an open source project, we work collaboratively on our codebase on
      GitHub in a style that should be familiar to anyone who has participated
      in an OSS community before. If you haven’t — we’re happy to support you in
      defining and writing great feature descriptions, and breaking them down
      into dev tasks, and shipping them to customers around the world.
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      This is an early stage open source company, so there is an opportunity to
      take on a variety of tasks beyond the app, such as the backend of the
      website, and our API.
