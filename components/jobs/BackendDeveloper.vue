    <heading>Python Backend Developer - Role requirements</heading>

    <paragraph>
      We are looking for a backend developer to help us improve Rotki. You will
      work mostly with the founder (Lefteris) who is the main developer working
      in the backend. The task is to help in the development of new features,
      supporting more exchanges, more blockchains, more DeFi protocols and
      solving all issues/bugs that are coming our way.
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      This role is for an experienced developer
      <span :class="$style.bold">
        who can take initiative, does not need constant monitoring and can take
        on a lot of responsibility.
      </span>
      We need someone who can take ownership of a big part of rotki’s backend
      and help us get it to the next level.
    </paragraph>

    <paragraph>
      Since this is a startup you will probably wear a lot of hats and may need
      to also help with the backend/infrastructure of our website and API. The
      best fit would be someone who shares our values on opensource and privacy.
