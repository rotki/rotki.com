my partner and I use it to keep track of our net worth and work out what house we can afford and also just generally
keep an eye on how we're doing financially prior to Rotki we really had no idea where we were at, but no tools were
available that allowed us to kind of combine a view of everything - stocks, crypto and fiat.

we're buying our first house in a few months time, partly because we were able to plan better thanks to Rotki ðŸ™‚
