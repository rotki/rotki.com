description: rotki Refund and Cancellation Policy
---

rotki provides immediate access to digital features and content upon purchase.
Because access is granted instantly, all sales are final and **no refunds are offered once a subscription has been activated.**

You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation stops future renewals, but previously completed payments remain non-refundable.

By completing a purchase, you acknowledge that the service begins immediately and you expressly agree that this waives any statutory right of withdrawal or refund period that might otherwise apply.

This policy complies with Article 16(m) of the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU), which exempts digital content supplied immediately upon purchase from the standard 14-day withdrawal right.
