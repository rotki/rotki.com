Try [@rotkiapp](https://twitter.com/rotkiapp){:target="\_blank"} if you're looking for a private way to manage your crypto portfolio without sharing your email/data with an external accounting SaaS.

No email needed to create an account as it runs on your local machine. It allows you to aggregate multiple sources e.g. EVM/Bitcoin accounts (works w/ ENS too) and all major CEXs.

Can also help you identify any unclaimed/missed airdrops or generate PnL reports for accountability purposes.

And it's all open-sourced!
